Description:
This project, completed as part of my Project Management course, focused on the creation of a comprehensive plan for the AI-2025 initiative. I utilized industry-standard tools like MS Project to deliver a detailed Statement of Work (SOW), scheduling, budgeting, and interim closeout. Emphasis was placed on aligning project deliverables with the overarching business goals of increased stock valuation, improved sales forecasts, and operational cost savings.

Key Highlights:
 • Project Charter: Designed a detailed charter that included project scope, deliverables, roles, and responsibilities.
 • Comprehensive Planning:
 • Developed an MS Project schedule with task sheets, Gantt charts, and milestone tracking.
 • Created a cost overview to track actual and budgeted expenses, ensuring project feasibility.
 • Budget Management:
 • Defined a $500,000 budget incorporating direct costs, variable expenses, and opportunity costs.
 • Introduced KPI-driven incentives to align project outcomes with organizational goals.
 • Stakeholder Engagement:
 • Collaborated with stakeholders to address communication gaps, historical conflicts, and personnel concerns.
 • Ensured stakeholder buy-in through structured meetings and a well-defined decision-making framework.
 • Risk Mitigation:
 • Conducted pre-mortems to proactively identify and address potential risks.
 • Established contingency plans for deviations in scope, requirements, and economic conditions.
 • Closeout Activities:
 • Resolved information gaps, clarified roles and responsibilities, and enhanced organizational flexibility.
